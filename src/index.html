          <p>I am a recent graduate of Carleton College in beautiful, rural Northfield, Minnesota - the city
            of
            Cows, Colleges, and Contentment (<a
              href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120521054006/http://www.carlwiki.org/Cows,_Colleges,_and_Contentment">I'm
              serious</a>) with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science. I'm an American/British
            dual-national
            from the north end of Los Angeles in beautiful, suburban La Ca√±ada, California.</p>
          <p>I've had or been around computers for as long as I can remember. When I was young, I was really
            good
            at breaking them. Now, I still break things, but that tends to be code rather than drivers. All
            that
            tinkering has instilled in me a sense of curiosity and intrigue in technology, science, and the
            broader world, in a How It's Made kind of way. If you get to know me, you will quickly learn
            that I
            like space and astronomy, security, live event setup, and renewable energy.</p>
          <p>Now I work as an Audio Visual Technician at <a href="https://www.psav.com/">PSAV</a> in which I
            utilize my aforementioned technical background to setup events large and small, work with
            clients on
            any pop-up requests or problems, and assist third-party companies with their own setups. We
            strive
            for excellent customer service while delivering a high-quality experience. I am regularly
            experimenting with our equipment to better learn each device's nuances and abilities so that
            when
            the time comes, I will be ready to use it at a moment's notice.</p>
          <p>At Carleton, I worked as a Student Team Lead at <a
              href="https://apps.carleton.edu/campus/its/peps/">PEPS</a> (Presentation, Event, and
            Production
            Support) under the Information Technology Services department where I helped to manage other
            student
            staff with schedules, assignments, and training, support campus events with equipment such as
            microphones or projectors, check out equipment, and record and edit larger-scale events. Think
            of it
            like AV club. Additionally, I picked up anything that was needed at PEPS, such as developing our
            own
            system for using Raspberry Pi's to loop videos for installations across campus. In this role, I
            was
            often working with campus community members from faculty to admissions, advising them on
            equipment
            recommendations and proper setup.</p>
